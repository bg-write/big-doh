# Big Dâ€™oh: Homer Reads 'Cracking the Coding Interview'. Powered by React. (In development.)
## If Homer can do it, so can you.
### THE GOAL: To reinforce knowledge of algorithms and data structures while practicing top technical interview questions in JavaScript ... in a way even Homer Simpson could get it. This React app is meant as a study guide for myself and anyone else going through Gayle Laakmann McDowell's 6th Edition of 'Cracking the Coding Interview'.
