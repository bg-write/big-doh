Did you do a coding Bootcamp and read 'Cracking the Coding Interview' but still struggle with Big O?

Welcome!

This free study aid is for anyone preparing for technical interviews to better understand Big O and common algorithms and data structures.

THE GOAL: To reinforce high-level knowledge of key algorithms and data structures from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's 6th Edition of 'Cracking the Coding Interview,' in a way even Homer Simpson could understand.

This app is not meant to be the definitive or all-encompassing resource, but rather a beginner's guide to navigating key concepts in software engineering and computer science. YouTube links are included to deepen understanding and encourage ongoing learning. And if you're stressed, you can always play Homer in a game of Tic-Tac-D'oh.

Big D'oh is a mobile-first designed React app made by Brady Gerber and Molly Hodson.
