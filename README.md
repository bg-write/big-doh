# Big Dâ€™oh: Homer Reads 'Cracking the Coding Interview'

## If Homer can do it, so can you.

Have you read 'Cracking the Coding Interview' but are still struggling with Big O? This free study guide is for anyone preparing for technical interviews and wishing to better understand Big O and common algorithms and data structures.

THE GOAL: To reinforce high-level knowledge of key algorithms and data structures pulled from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's 6th Edition of 'Cracking the Coding Interview' in a way even Homer Simpson could understand.

This app is not meant to be a definitive or all-encompassing resource but rather a beginner's guide to navigating key concepts in software engineering and computer science. YouTube links are included to deepen understanding and to encourge ongoing learning. And if you're stressed, you can always play Homer in a game of Tic-Tac-D'oh.

Big D'oh is a mobile-friendly React app made by General Assembly alumni Brady Gerber and Molly Hodson.
