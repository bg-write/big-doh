# Big Dâ€™oh: Homer Reads 'Cracking the Coding Interview'
## If Homer can do it, so can you.

This mobile-first React app is a free beginner's study guide to help anyone prepare for technical interviews and learn about Big O and common algorithms and data structures. Concepts are pulled from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's 6th Edition of 'Cracking the Coding Interview' (6th Edition) and General Assembly's Full-Stack Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.

THE GOAL: To introduce and reinforce knowledge of algorithms and data structures while practicing popular technical interview questions in JavaScript ... in a way even Homer Simpson could understand. This app is not meant to be the definitive reference but rather one's first guide to navigating key concepts in software engineering and computer science. YouTube links are included to deepen understanding and encourge ongoing learning. And if you're stressed, you can always play against Homer in a game of Tic-Tac-D'oh.
